Project Title: Puppy Bowl 
Here is a brief description of our project, "Puppy Bowl". Our team PuppyBowlGroup2 is currently working with the humane society to enhance their website by creating a mini-game.
We were instructed to lay out the game so to allow visitors to create teams of puppies to compete in a "puppy bowl"
In addition, the Humane society has provided our team a rough built out API from a previous contractor. In addition, we were also provided part of some of the front-end 
and the a GitHub link to for our team to make our contributions for this project.
Overall, our job is to build out a functional client side. Request data from the API, then render that data on the front end! The front-end should allow the user to the following listed below: 

1- view the roster
2- see a player's details
3- add players to the roster
4- ...and more!
